            <p>
                Welcome to our organization! We strive to make the world a better place by reducing food waste
                and helping those in need. Our mission is to unite partners and volunteers to save food products
                and ensure their fair distribution.
            </p>

            <p>
                We collaborate with cafes, restaurants, shops, and other food suppliers to collect surplus food
                and direct it to where it is truly needed. Our team works with love and care so that everyone
                can contribute to the common cause.
            </p>

            <p class="eco-warning">
                ♻️ One of the key goals of our project is environmental care. Food waste releases methane—a greenhouse gas
                dozens of times more harmful than carbon dioxide. It pollutes soil and water, increases the carbon footprint,
                and contributes to global warming. By reducing food waste, we not only help people but also protect
                nature from irreversible harm.
            </p>

            <p>
                Join us and become part of the solution—together we can change the future!
