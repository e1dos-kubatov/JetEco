            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <p>
                Our system is simple: partners, such as cafes and shops, post their surplus food.
                Users choose the products they want through the platform and place an order.
                Our goal is not only to reduce food waste but also to make food accessible to everyone.
                We provide users with the opportunity to purchase high-quality products at significant discounts,
                while also actively participating in charitable activities by connecting partners with those in need.
            </p>
            <p>
                All meals and products remain fully edible and comply with sanitary standards.
                We strive to make the process as efficient and eco-friendly as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="eco-note">♻️ This helps both people and the environment—less food ends up in landfills, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving the planet's resources.</p>
